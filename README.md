# DDNS
In order to figure out what's DNS and how it work, I would Implement Dynamic DNS server in User-level.

# What's the difference of DNS and DDNS?

**DNS server** uses `master file` to record the mapping relationship of Domain Name and IP.
The `master file` is just a  text file, and lack of flexibility to change the mapping.
That's why **DDNS server** comes.**DDNS server** extends `MESSAGE format`(is used to query) to support that dynamically modify the `master file`.

### Name Server Architecture:
```
                 Local Host                        |  Foreign
                                                   |
      +---------+                                  |
     /         /|                                  |

    +---------+               +----------+         |
```

### Resolver Architecture:
```

                 Local Host                        |  Foreign
                                                   |
